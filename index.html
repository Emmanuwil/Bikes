                        The scooter’s official top speed is 18 mph, with a remarkable and smooth acceleration speed, ensuring a stable ride. Since the manufacturer’s official top speed is determined under ideal situations, riders in real-world tests have cited not reaching the top speed. Factors such as the rider’s weight, road conditions, and battery level affect a scooter’s speed. The scooter has one ride mode, which would deter entry-level riders (if the price didn’t already).

                        The Bird One comes with a 36V, 12800 mAh lithium-ion battery that can power the scooter for up to 25 miles on a single charge. The battery and the power supply are housed in the deck. While the scooter lacks a display on the handlebar, it displays the battery level on the Bird app. The app notifies you when the level gets dangerously low.

                        The One comes with automatic LED front and rear 30-40 lumens lights. The in-built LED headlight is encased together with the GPS. It provides enough light to allow you to ride even at night. This Bird also comes with reflective light strips on both sides of the front and rear tyres.  The lights are switched on through the Bird app. The rear flashing light comes on when you engage the brakes to alert other road users.
